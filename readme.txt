Add custom javascripts and styles to pages and posts as well as your entire site.

== Description ==
Tired of having to edit page templates or override theme options just to change one little thing?  Tired of having to "!important" your styles?

Well, we can't guarantee you won't have to do that anymore :) BUT, we can offer you a way to hopefully have to do LESS of it.  Simply install our Custom CSS/JS plugin and you can add custom styles and scripts not only to your entire site but to individual pages and posts!

- Specify javascripts and styles to use on specific pages/posts OR on a global (site wide) basis.
- Will load external javascript references first so that you can reference them in your in-page javascripts.
- Simple and easy to use!


== Installation ==
Simply copy the Custom CSS/JS plugin to your plugins folder, login to your admin and activate it through the Plugins Manager.  No other setup necessary!
